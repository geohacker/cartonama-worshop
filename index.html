        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Location based services (LBS) are becoming the order of the day. At any given point in time, individuals are searching for the closest ATM or restaurant around their homes/offices, plotting their location on Twitter and Facebook to keep their friends updated about their whereabouts, checking the situation with traffic while commuting, etc. With services boiling down to personalization and context, location provides a key dimension. The possibilities in the area of location based services are therefore immense.</p>
        <p>Cartonama workshop is based on the understanding that people need to learn more about the tools with which they can manage their geographic data. This workshop will provide a platform where developers, neogeographers and entrepreneurs working on location based services will get hands-on understanding about advanced tools - server side and client side - to manage and represent their geographic data.</p>
        <p>The workshop will involve hands-on experience and training to work with tools ranging from databases, tile servers, TileMill, Geocoding APIs, Search APIs and JavaScript front end libraries. - OpenLayers and Leaflet. Discussion sessions and lectures on issues such as quality of open geographic data, commercialization, licensing and privacy are interspersed between the hands-on training sessions. This format will allow participants to think through the practical and conceptual issues that are arising or will potentially arise when they are working with their own geographic datasets to develop location based services.

                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p><a href="http://hasgeek.com/" target="_blank">HasGeek</a> is a developer-led initiative, and has been un-organising the unconference scene since 2010. HasGeek is an attempt to solve the problem of insipid conferences organised around buzzwords by uninterested, soulless corporate entities who pitch them as company training events or as places for companies to pick up hot developers.</p>
                <p>We are attempting to build a new space, a space that is genuinely respectful of the communities and topics that we choose to engage with. We want to be a space for developers who are as excited as us about technology and the possibilities that it creates, not to be a recruitment fair (though we hope you do find partnership possibilities at our events).</p>
                <p>We are community-driven — check out our speaker-selection funnel, where you decide what talks to listen to by voting up or down — and small — there are just a handful of us running the show. We are doing this because this is what we love: bringing a whole bunch of us geeks together, sharing our interests and expertise and hanging out later over $beverageOfChoice.</p>
